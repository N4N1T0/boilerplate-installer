# Nanito's Personalized Boilerplate Creator

## Description

Have you ever been stuck at the beginning of a project, trying to decide on the proper stack to have the best developer experience? A couple of hours later, you realize this process can be automated. That was me at the beginning of creating this package. I developed a simple CLI that copies the boilerplate of two apps, one with Next.js and one with Astro, using the best and newest tech for your project journey.

## Features

- **Shadcn UI**: A library for building user interfaces.
- **Biome**: A command line tool for formatting and linting code.
- **Husky**: Pre-commit hooks for running linters and formatters.
- **Partytown**: A lazy-loaded library to help relocate resource-intensive scripts.
- **Million.js**: A new approach to Virtual DOM, offering a 70% performance increase.
- **Useful Architecture**: Folder structures specifically designed for Next.js and Astro apps.

## Installation

To install and set up the boilerplate, simply run the following command:

```bash
npx my-boilerplate-installer
